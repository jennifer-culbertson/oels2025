Full content for the course (code walkthroughs etc) in a readable format is at [https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io/oels2025/](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io/oels2025/), you can find the markdown source and zipped code on the gh-pages branch.

Here on you can inspect individual pieces of code, some of which I had to zip up in the webpage version for convenience of the people downloading them.
